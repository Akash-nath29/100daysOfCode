# Introduction 📜:
Dark patterns are user interfaces designed to trick people. They are carefully crafted to mislead users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills. Usually, these are designed to benefit the company, not the user. The goal of this project is to create a browser extension that can help users identify and avoid dark patterns on e-commerce websites.

# Features 🌟:
- **Dark Pattern Detection**: The extension will detect dark patterns on e-commerce websites and alert the user.
- **User Feedback**: Users can report dark patterns that they encounter.
- **User Reviews**: Users can view reviews of e-commerce websites and their dark patterns.
- **WebSaathi**: A chatbot that can help users with their queries and provide information about dark patterns.

# Technologies Used 🛠️:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Pattern Ditection Model**: joblib, kaggler, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
